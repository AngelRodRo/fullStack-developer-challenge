## ðŸš€ Getting Started


### How to run application

1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
2. Start by creating a new .env file using this format, ensuring all variables are filled in as they are **required**:
    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPHQL_API=
    ```
   Note: By default is set to http://localhost:4000

3. To start the app in server mode, run the following command:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
   ***Note:*** This command includes the codegen generator, which means it runs both the GraphQL server and the Codegen in parallel, continuously watching for any modifications to GraphQL files to create new types.

### Run tests

```
npm run test
```
